Hello, this program has been created using the infrastructure of programs like sqlmap and nmap. 
My sole purpose is to facilitate web hacking. 
For example, let’s say we want to perform port scanning with nmap, but we occasionally forget the command. 
With the program I’ve developed, you don’t need to know it. 
Just select the operation you want, and let BEKO INJECT handle the rest.
I am not responsible for any actions taken; my sole purpose is education. 
This program is still in the development stage, so you could call it a demo mode. 
Thank you for reading this far. 
Rest assured, there are no viruses in this program; it’s purely intended to make people’s work easier. 
Thanks bye
